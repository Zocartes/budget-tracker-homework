## User Story

As AN avid traveler I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connections SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling.

## Description

Budget Tracker allows users to add expenses and deposits to their budget. I've added functionality to allow the user to do so without a connection. When a user enters a transaction offline, it will populate the total when brought back online.

When a user opens the application, they are presented with the home page. There a user is able to add an expense and add it to their budget. This change is shown on the graph. If a user is offline, the app will still function, and when the user goes back online it will populate the total.
